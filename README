git-release is a general release tool for git.

It is written in Bourne Shell though it should be compatible with Bash as well.

The script keeps it's configuration in a 'git config' formatted file.
The configuration file name is .releaserc.
To create the initial configuration run 'release.sh config'.

This script requires GNU shtool (http://www.gnu.org/software/shtool/) to handle lexical version names.
It also depends on the makeself tool (http://megastep.org/makeself/) to create self-extracting archives.
Neither of these tools are bundled with the script.

At this time this is not a general purpose tool, but I will be working on making it more flexible and
generic.  I'm happy to take feature requests and/or patches.
